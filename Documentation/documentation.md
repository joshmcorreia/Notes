# Documentation Notes

## Best Practices
[styleguide Documentation Best Practices](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/best_practices.html)
> A small set of fresh and accurate docs are better than a sprawling, loose assembly of “documentation” in various states of disrepair.

> Docs work best when they are alive but frequently trimmed, like a bonsai tree.

> Dead docs are bad. They misinform, they slow down, they incite despair in engineers and laziness in team leads. They set a precedent for leaving behind messes in a code base. If your home is clean, most guests will be clean without being asked.

> It’s easy to write something a computer understands, it’s much harder to write something both a human and a computer understand. Your mission as a Code Health-conscious engineer is to write for humans first, computers second. Documentation is an important part of this skill.

> the most important things to document are the decisions. This goes for everything from requirements to architectural choices. What are the requirements of module X? How are these requirements represented in the architecture? Why did you choose architectural pattern A over B? What are the benefits?

> too much documentation, and you end up spending as much time maintaining the documentation as you do maintaining the project

> It is good for knowledge transfer. Not all code is equally obvious. There might be some complex algorithms or custom workarounds that are not clear enough for other developers.

> Product documentation describes dependencies between system modules and third-party tools. Thus, it may be needed for integration purposes.

> Some teams may prefer to skip code documentation in order to save time, money and effort. Keep in mind though that this might result in even more significant expenses once the product is transferred to another team or when updates are required down the line.

## Confluence vs READMEs
[Why You Shouldn’t Use Confluence for Code Documentation](https://medium.com/codex/why-you-shouldnt-use-confluence-for-code-documentation-9363d025951c)
- Developers work in code repositories, not Confluence
- Small changes to code can make documentation stale, such as adding or removing a button
- Developers may not be aware of all the documentation on Confluence
- Lack of peer review (no merge requests in Confluence like there are in code repos)
