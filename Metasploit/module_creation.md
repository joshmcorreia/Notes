# Documentation

The [GitHub page](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki) is an incredibly useful resource.

Here is some of the documentation that I've found particularly useful (in the order that you should read it, too)
- [Contributing to Metasploit 1](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Contributing-to-Metasploit)
- [Contributing to Metasploit 2](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [Get Started Writing an Exploit](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Get-Started-Writing-an-Exploit)
- [Guidelines for Accepting Modules and Enhancements](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/wiki/Guidelines-for-Accepting-Modules-and-Enhancements)
