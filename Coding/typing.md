# Language Typing:

## Statically typed

Explanation: The type of a variable is known at compile time, and typing is associated with the variable instead of the value. Once a variable's type is set, it cannot be changed.

Examples:
- C
- C++
- C#
- Java
- Rust

## Dynamically typed

Explanation: The type is associated with run-time values and not the variables themselves. This means that a variable's type can be changed.

Example languages:
- Python
- JavaScript

## Strongly typed
