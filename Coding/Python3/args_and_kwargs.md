## args and kwargs
You've probably seen `*args` and `**kwargs` in code before, but it isn't immediately clear what they do.

- `*args` stands for "arguments"
- `**kwargs` stands for "keyword arguments"

`*args` and `**kwargs` allow you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments or keyword arguments to a function.
